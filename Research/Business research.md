## What is a business process?

According to searchcio (Roy & McLaughlin, 2018) a business process is an activity or set of activities that can accomplish a specific organizational goal. Business processes should have purposeful goals, be as specific as possible and have consistent outcomes.

## How does a business process relate to a software application?

In this paper from David Chappell  (Chappell, 2012) it says: A structured business process carries out a pre-defined sequence of steps. The process might have many options, with different steps carried out by different instances of the process at different times. Still, the creators of the process determined what the possible steps were in advance. When a structured business process is supported by an application, it’s common for the software to implement the complete process. Think of an automated manufacturing process, for example, where an application directs a group of machines to repeat the same steps over and over. In situations like this, people primarily provide inputs, accept outputs, and handle exceptions. The software carries out the process itself.

# Questions related to your project

## Does your software automate tasks, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform?

The software we are making in the group project automates ordering for customers. After the customer scans the Qr code on the table and made an order the kitchen gets the order on the kitchen dashboard. Everything is done with software. Adding, deleting and editing category’s/dishes are easier now in this system. In the admin panel you can choose whatever you want to do.

## Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?

Below is the process shown on the diagram. The customer first scans the Qr code and  will be redirected to the menu page. After this the customer will choose the products he wants and adds them to the basket. When all the products have bin chosen the customer is able to order them. Note that if there are no products in the basket you are not able to make an order. When the order is the customer is able to look at the order information and the order will be send to the kitchen.

## Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence?

Customer:
> A good thing that is automated is that the customer can order as soon as he sits at the table and scanned the Qr code. This way the process goes way faster for ordering food.

Waiter:
> For the waiters there are a lot of benefits here. They don’t have to go to the table to ask what the customer wants to eat because this is all automated with this software. The only thing that they have to do is go and bring the customer his/her food.

Chef: 
> When the order is made and send to the kitchen the chef is able to see all the orders on a dashboard. This way he/she doesn’t have to work with papers or anything else. This automated process makes it very easy.

## Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize this in a diagram? 

There are 2 steps in this process that are automated. The first one is scanning the Qr code. When the customer scans it he/she will be automatically redirected to the menu page where the customer is able to choose their products. The second one is getting the order from the customer to the kitchen. After an order is made the kitchen gets a message on the kitchen dashboard when there is a new order. This way the waiters don’t need to go to the table and ask what the customer wants to eat and write it all down. The software will handle this process.

## What has changed regarding to the old and new process?

In the old process the waiters need to write every order down with pen and paper. This process takes a lot of time and is not efficient. Our software made this very fast by using tablets/phones for the customer so they can order themselves. Also after that the order is send to the kitchen immediately. This process is also faster because earlier the waiters needed to walk up and down all the time to let the kitchen. With the software they get a message when an order is done and the kitchen gets a message when the order is made. So it saves a lot off time overall.
