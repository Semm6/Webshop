## Ethics

### What is ethics in software engineering?

Ethics according to the dictionary means: norms of behavior. In a general sense, ethics tries to establish the criteria for judging whether an action can be qualified as right or wrong. Regarding ethics in software development, there is a lot of information on this subject in this [Quroa](https://www.quora.com/What-are-software-engineering-ethics) blog post. Thomas Hanssen has 37 years of experience in software and has commented on this blog post. He says that everyone is different about this, but that he has 3 points:


1. Respect individual’s free will - Implying don’t create something that eliminates individual’s ability to make choices for themselves, assuming they’re not engaging in eliminating other individual’s free will themselves in the first place, at which point you have the right to eliminate their free will, because their free wills implies removing other individual’s free will.

2. Respect individual’s free will - Implying don’t create something that eliminates individual’s ability to make choices for themselves, assuming they’re not engaging in eliminating other individual’s free will themselves in the first place, at which point you have the right to eliminate their free will, because their free wills implies removing other individual’s free will.

3. Be as truthful as you can, by informing your employer to at least some extent about the consequences of what he asks you to do - And do not engage in anything violating any of the two above points, regardless of who asks you, or what type of coercion they’re using to attempt to “make you do it”. You are responsible for your own actions, regardless of who orders you to do whatever it is you feel obliged or forced to do.


### Why is ethics important in software engineering? 

According to [York.ac](https://online.york.ac.uk/why-ethics-must-be-a-constant-in-software-engineering/) software can change how we act and think, having a strong ethical core to the platform is a must. Platforms like Reddit and Twitter have been accused of not doing enough to prevent the spread of misinformation and hate speech, but it’s extremely unlikely that the engineers writing the code would’ve considered that their software would be used for such purposes. Software engineers are rarely experts in psychology or ethics, despite having an innate understanding of both. During the design process would anyone ask ‘Who could be negatively affected by this?’ or entertain the unpleasant prospect that their work could be used to disadvantage people.

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?

The ACM Software Engineering Code of ethics is a good way to work ethically as a software engineer. As [ACM.org](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)  says: Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and      maintenance.
6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.


### How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 

A good way to know someones ethics is to have a conversation with them about it. For example if we have different ethical view on life. This way I can see if we match or not. Then I won’t	let differences come in between us if we work together in a group project. So I will always stay professional.

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project?

A good ethical aspects in our project Is using code that we find on the internet. So grabbing code is ethical for the product.The majority of software engineers looks a problem up on the internet if they don’t know the answer to it. Although many people grab the code even if they don’t understand it. That is bad behaviour and you’ll not learn anything.

### Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  

For the group project I did some front-end development. Before I implemented a proper UI/UX I made some designs for the PO. This way I received feedback to make changes needed. After I made these designs and discussed them with the PO I did some tests on potential users from the application. This way I can foresee the conflicts because I knew what everyone’s thought’s were about it.

### Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts? 

A good way to avoid/minimize conflicts is to ask a lot of feedback from In this case the PO and potential customers as mentioned above. If there is a lot of feedback you maybe need to consider changing a lot of things. After the changes you are still avoiding/minimizing the conflicts.

## Culture

### What is culture? 

Culture as defined by [Ensie](https://www.ensie.nl/redactie-ensie/cultuur) means:

> the habits and customs that a people has in the country itself or that a people takes with them from the country of origin. This includes the whole of norms and values, food, eating habits, clothing, religion and music and dance. This also includes uses such as body decoration with henna, which is mainly found in Arab, African and Indian cultures. The meaning of a color can also differ from culture to culture. In the Netherlands, for example, black is the mourning color, while in China and Japan it is white. Body language also plays a role, and non-verbal communication may differ. It also includes the way of life: what does the working population live on, what are the traditions, and how are the buildings designed. The culture is in fact a sum of these characteristics

### Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences?

This podcast from freakonomics sad that there was an incident in Singapore with an American teenager. He was arrested and charged various counts of vandalism. And he was gonna be punished for it. When President Clinton heard about it he sad the following below (the Singaporean government reaction is also mentioned).

> GELFAND: Clinton went to negotiate to say, “Hey, this is just totally inappropriate, this punishment.” And the Singaporean government’s reaction was, “Look, this is our culture. If you’re violating the social order, you’re going to be punished.” (The U.S. Is Just Different — So Let’s Stop Pretending We’re Not (Ep. 469), 2021)

So it's good to remember that the rules can be very different in other cultures. And if you are in another country it's also good to look into this.  

### How can cultures be clustured? 

Many cultures are brought together because they live in the same country. The Netherlands is a good example of this. In this country there are many cultures together, which is why it is also called a multicultural society. Another good example is sports. If you are part of a team sport in the Netherlands, you will sometimes have to deal with players from different cultures.

### Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 

According to [Mindtools](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/cross-cultural-mistakes.htm) there are many mistakes that can be made. Below I will name 4 of them mentioned in this research each with one example.

Food:
> In Asian and Russian cultures, it's common not to talk during a meal because the food is the focus. Most conversation takes place after dinner. This isn't the case in, for example, Japan, where colleagues often discuss work after hours and while socializing over a meal.

Body language and gestures:
> Certain gestures considered acceptable in one country can be highly offensive in another. For example, a "thumbs up" gesture is seen as a sign of satisfaction in the West, but is highly offensive in some Middle Eastern countries.

Clothing and color:
> In the South Pacific, Asia, Thailand, and Russia, it's courteous to remove your shoes before entering a home. This helps maintain cleanliness; but it's also a sign that you're leaving the outside world where it belongs.

Personal space:
> In the United States, many people prefer to keep one to two meters' space between friends and family members, and up to three meters between strangers and business associates. These preferences are similar in the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, and other European countries.

### What is your culture? 

My culture is to work hard every day. I also communicate a lot with people and try to learn from them. At night I sometimes play online games with people from all over the world. I communicate with an online platform called discord.

### How would you  act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?

When im talking to someone I don’t know personally im always quiet and careful at the beginning. The reason for this is to see how he reacts to certain things and how the person is in general. This way I know most of the time how to talk to them. Beside this its always good to be respectful to anyone. 

### High and low context
Below are some differences between high and low context cultures. For example low context is more focused on individual success while the high context is more team oriented. On the table below you can see more differences.
