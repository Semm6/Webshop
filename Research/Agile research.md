## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?

#### Agile development:

According to agile alliance (Agile Alliance, 2021) agile development means: 

> Agile software development is more than frameworks such as Scrum, Extreme Programming, or Feature-Driven Development (FDD).

> Agile software development is more than practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints.

> Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it’s generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context.

#### Agile manifesto:

According to productplan (Agile Manifesto, 2021) the agile manifesto means:

The Agile Manifesto outlines a set of 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development. Below are the 4 values.

#### Agile principles:

On agile alliance (Agile Alliance, 2021a) I also found a good overview of the 12 principles.

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?

According to this xpand (Lamelas, 2021) these agile methods are the most popular below I mentioned the top 3.

#### 1. Scrum

Scrum is, undoubtedly, the most used of the many frameworks of the Agile methodology. Scrum is characterised by cycles or stages of development, known as sprints, and by the maximisation of development time for a software product. It is usually used in the management of development projects for software products, but it can also be used in a business-related context.
Every day there are small 15-minute meetings, the daily scrum, that take the role of synchronising activities and finding the best way to plan the workday.

##### Advantages

- There is a lot of motivation in teams, because programmers want to meet the deadline of every sprint;
- The transparency allows for the project to be followed by all members of a team or even an organization;
- The focus on quality is a constant in the scrum method, resulting in fewer mistakes.
- The dynamics of this method allow developers to reorganise priorities, ensuring that sprints that have not yet been completed get more attention

##### Disadvantages

- The segmentation of the project and the search for agility of the development can sometimes lead the team to lose track of the project as a whole, focusing only on one part;
- Each developer’s role may not be well defined, resulting in some confusion amongst team members.

#### 2. Kanban


The word Kanban is of Japanese origin and its meaning is linked to a time concept, “just-in-time”. In practice, the Kanban method exists in a board or table (Kanban board), divided into columns, that shows every flow of the software production. As the development evolves, the information contained in the table changes, and when a new task comes into play, a new “card” is created.
The Kanban method requires communication and transparency so that the members of a team can know exactly at what stage the development is and can see the status of the project at any time.

##### Advantages

- Ability to view all tasks of one project (Completed, In Progress or In Testing, for example);
- It is possible to limit the number of running tasks (that is, the amount of work, bearing in mind its resolution or deliverability);
- Focus on the duration of a cycle – how long it takes a task to go from backlog to the final stage;
- Allows continuous deliveries.

##### Disadvantages

- It is possible for members of a team to misinterpret the information show on the Kanban Board, especially when it is revealed as outdated;
- Since there are no timeframes in Kanban, you can face time related problems, such as delays, associated with each and every stage.

#### 3. Extreme Programming (XP)
This is a typical Agile Development framework, developed by Kent Beck, and can be adapted to development companies of various dimensions. It is a methodology that emphasis values such as Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage and Respect and prioritises customer satisfaction over everything else. This methodology offers trust to the developers by motivating them to accept changes in the customer’s requirements, even if they arrive in a later stage of the development cycle.
Teamwork is extremely important in XP, since when there is a problem, it is solved by the whole team of managers, developers or customers. They are all essential pieces of the same puzzle, hence creating a fertile environment for high productivity and efficiency in a team. In Extreme Programming, software is tested from day one, collecting feedback to improve development.

##### Advantages

- The simplicity of the written code works as an advantage, since it allows for its improvement at any given time;
- The whole process and the whole cycle of XP development is visible, therefore creating goals for developers and showing results in a relatively fast way;
- Software development turns out to be more agile than in other methodologies, precisely because of the constant testing;
- XP also contributes to uplifting the talent of the teams and to their withholding.

##### Disadvantages

- The extreme focus on code can lead to less importance being paid to design, hence requiring extra attention to that matter;
- This framework may not work in the best way possible if all team members are not working in the same geographical area;
- In XP projects, a registry of possible errors is not always maintained, and that lack of monitoring can lead to similar bugs in the future.

## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?

According to atlassian (Atlassian, 2020) scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve. While the scrum I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

## Can you explain two or more agile methods and name number of interesting features in them different from scrum?

Above I already mentioned 2 agile methods: Kanban and Extreme programming. Below I will show some interesting features different than scrum.

##### KanBan:

- According to wijzijnwin (Schijff, 2020) an interesting thing about Kanban is that you don’t have sprints with this method. You can pick things from the backlog all the time and place it on the board. Scrum against it uses sprints to do certain tasks in a 2-4 week time. For example if you need to deliver contiguous then its better to use scrum because deliver certain features every 2-4 weeks.


##### Extreme programming:

- According to visual-paradigm (Extreme Programming (XP) vs Scrum, 2020) with extreme programming you are able to change what you wanna do in a sprint. So for example if you did not start on feature 1 yet you can just swap it out for feature 2 if that’s what’s mot important at that time. In Scrum you are not able to do that because you are not allow to make changes in the sprints. As soon as you made a set of backlog items that set remains unchanged trough the end of the sprint.

#### Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods?

##### 1. JB King on stackoverflow

On stack overflow i found this (What is software development at your company really like (methodologies, tools, . . .)?, 2008) general question on how software development is at your company. I found a person called: JB King. He sad this about his job related to Agile.

> We use Scrum and have stand ups, story board, Iteration Planning Meeting (That is really for the sprint and not an iteration which is 2 sprints as after each pair of sprints the work is shown to executives and other departments while the other demo is for an architect and the head of the content entering team.)

##### 2. NickServ on the reactiflux discord

Nick is an admin on the big discord channel of reactiflux. I had a small interview with him about the tools he used and studied in his time as a software engineer.

Question 1: 
> Which agile methods do you use at work?

Answer: 
> I have mostly used scrum and kanban. Though in my experience many teams that follow "scrum" are following a simplified and customized version of it. People can be certified scrum masters though, that has more restrictions.  

Question 2: 
>Do you like working with scrum and kanban at work?

Answer:
> Depends on the complexity of the project and resources of the team. Scrum is significantly more process than Kanban, which makes Scrum more organized, but Kanban easier to adapt.

Question 3: 
> Did you ever do extreme programming?

Answer:
> It encourages some good engineering practices like testing but the process isn’t as honed as Scrum.

General opinion:
> If you have a small team and you’re not sure what to do, I’d recommend starting with Kanban And if you’re not already familiar with basic software engineering principles, they can help a lot, regardless of the methodology/model you pick.

## Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?

We are currently using JIRA with a scrum board. This works good for us because we can make a lot of small branches for every sub task. A scrum is also used in this software because we keep track of all our tasks on the board. This helps us a lot with organizing. JIRA also gives good benefits for LO2 because It can be customized to match a business process. 

Another good reason the group picked for JIRA is because we wanted to learn in a new environment. All of the group members saw a lot of potential in this software and we wanted to try it out with our group this semester.

If you are not familiar with JIRA here is an explanation from proofhub (Kashyap, 2020):

JIRA is a tracking tool that is used for Agile testing as well as project management. It is developed for bug tracking, issue tracking and project management to software and mobile development processes. Some of the key features include capture, assign, and set priorities to do work. With Jira, teams get visibility into long term goals and real-time release information. The dashboard on JIRA can be customized to match your business processes.
